How to Run the Code (Task 2 to Task 5)
My solution code for this project is in a jupyter notebook. 
Open the Assignment 1.ipynb file
For task 2 run the code cell block under the cell "Task 2".
For task 3 run the code cell block under the cell "Task 3".
and finally for task 4 run the code cell block under the cell "Task 4".
Jupyter notebook uses Python 3 ipykernel
In the code numpy and heapq libraries are included.
